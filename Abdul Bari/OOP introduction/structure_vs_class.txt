In C language we find structure (struct) which contains only data and
in C++ we fin class where both data and functions can be used. Structure 
can also be used in C++ which behaves like a class only so it does not
matter whether we use structure or class in C++.

In C++, structure is by deafult public to the main fucntion and class is by deafult 
private to the main fucntion. This is main difference between structure and class. 

In C language we have pointer but not oop and in Java we have oop but not pointer. In C++
we have both of these built in functions for whicha unique feature can be found that is
Pointer to an Object since C++ has both pointer and oop built in functions.
